# Employees punctuality tracker

Imagine this: You arrive early to your job. It is a beatiful and sunny day to work, you greet everyone in the office. 

Everything seems perfect, and since your company does not has any software tool to track whether you arrived o'clock or not you just save your things in the locker, and start your workday.

When you are at the point of leaving (because you completed your daily schedule and tasks) your superior out of the blue, tells you that if you keep arriving late to the office, you will be fired, how can you demonstrate that you did not arrived late?

Well, it is an unfair situation to face, and because you do not have any proof to demonstrate the oppossite unfortunately you have no power to argue it.

However, this little tool helps you to avoid that uncomfortable and unfair situation. 

If you are in a management position (even if you are not), this tool can help to track employees punctuality or tardiness.

Therefore, helping you to demonstrate that you arrived early and obligating your superior to say sorry.
